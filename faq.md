## How do I sign up?
[[Click here!]](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6lrnab-gm-ds5xsi8Ss5j3E-ZTUc0ipSNQYOEvSzRbkoKhw/viewform) to sign up. Please fill out the form fully. You can sign up as a team or leave us your information to be matched with others looking for teams. 

## Is there a registration fee?
No! This is a free event!

## Who is eligible to compete?
All CSU Chico undergraduate students are eligible to compete.

## What about MS students?
We would love to have Masters students get involved as consultants during the event.

## How large are the teams?
Teams can be made up of 2-5 students.

## Do I have to compete in a team?
Yes, but if you don't have a team in mind, leave us your info and we'll match you with others in the same boat.

## What do I need to compete?
All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on which software you use) and enthusiasm for data.

## What are the rules of the competition?
The rules are very simple:

-No more than five students per team.
-No fewer than 2 students per team.  
-Team members can come and go as they please but all work has to be done on-site. A steady supply of food, beverage, and candy make it more inviting to stay.  
-It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Official ASA DataFestTM consultants (grad students, faculty, data professionals, etc.) will also be around throughout the weekend to help with any questions you might have. However you can't have outside help.   

## Do we have to stay the entire time?  
No. You may come and go as you please. However, you are not allowed to work on the project except while you are on ASA DataFestTM grounds, and at least 3 members of your team must attend the introduction.

## What can I win?
Fame, glory, prizes or some combination thereof... And you get a t-shirt!

## Where else is ASA DataFestTM happening?
ASA DataFestTM is growing fast! See [[here]](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/participants.cfm) for a list of all participating institutions. If you are interested in holding ASA DataFestTM at your institution, click here to get more information on the event.

# Just want to help put on this awesome event? {#helpout}
There are three ways to help out and support DataFest. Individuals and business are both needed. 
Here is a [video by Rob Gould](http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/support-datafest/) from UCLA discussing the benefits of supporting this event. 


## Consultants
Alumni? Graduate student? Recruiter? We need your help! Come spend a few hours helping students navigate their way through this complex and rich data set. Don't know code very well? That's fine, everyone needs a sounding board! Plus they have to develop presentations to communicate their findings. 

## Judges


## Sponsors
This event can not occur without sponsors who donate supplies, food and swag, and money to cover additional costs such as room reservation fees, t-shirts and prizes.

Participants **must** not work on DataFest related activities while off-premises. So the more we can feed and refresh the students on site, they will be able to put in their best efforts. 

See our [sponsor](sponsors.html) page for more details on how to give.
