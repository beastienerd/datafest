# Is there a registration fee?
No! This is a free event!

# Who is eligible to compete?
All CSU Chico undergraduate students are eligible to compete.

# What about MS students?
We would love to have Masters students get involved as consultants during the event.

# How large are the teams?
Teams can be made up of 2-5 students.

# Do I have to compete in a team?
Yes, but if you don't have a team in mind, leave us your info and we'll match you with others in the same boat.

# What do I need to compete?
All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on which software you use) and enthusiasm for data.

# What are the rules of the competition?
The rules are very simple:

-No more than five students per team.
-No fewer than 2 students per team.  
-Team members can come and go as they please but all work has to be done on-site. A steady supply of food, beverage, and candy make it more inviting to stay.  
-It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Official ASA DataFestTM consultants (grad students, faculty, data professionals, etc.) will also be around throughout the weekend to help with any questions you might have. However you can't have outside help.   

# Do we have to stay the entire time?  
No. You may come and go as you please. However, you are not allowed to work on the project except while you are on ASA DataFestTM grounds, and at least 3 members of your team must attend the introduction.

# What can I win?
Fame, glory, prizes or some combination thereof... And you get a t-shirt!

# Where else is ASA DataFestTM happening?
