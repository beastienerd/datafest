## DataFest 2018
Our first year saw 12 undergraduate students from Applied Mathematics, Statistics, but also Computer Science, Construction Management, Civil Engineering, and Biology.

After two days of intense data wrangling, analysis, presentation design, interspersed with a lot of good free food and caffeine, each team presented their findings to a panel of judges consisting of both on and off campus professionals. Over $500 worth of prizes were given for Best in Show, Best Visualization, and Best Use of External
